Paragraphs are often made up of many sentences. They are usually between four to eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again; this makes telling when one paragraph ends and another begins easier.\nIn most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.\nA pilcrow mark is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins.\nParagraphs are important to essays, papers, columns, whatever you are writing. Paragraphs help separate ideas and let the audience know when you change partial topics. Each paragraph has maybe an average of 3 - 7 sentences, depending on the topic and how much information is required."
